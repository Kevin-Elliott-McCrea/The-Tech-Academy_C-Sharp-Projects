# The Tech Academy_C Sharp Projects
 
Here are a few substantial C-Sharp projects I've completed.

#### Twenty One

Here is a fully functioning game of Blackjack that I've created. There are several classes that control separate functions of the game. I used inheritance, abstract classes, validation of card/betting values with exceptions, and used a list for players and bets for multiplayer scalability to name a few features.

#### Car Insurance

Here is a MVC application that shows CRUD functionality, database interface and logic to determine a user's car insurance rates.

#### News Letter App

This is a web application with a database set up to receive a user's info who is interested in getting the weekly newsletter from a mock-company.

#### Tech Acad Students

This application demonstrates MVC structure and displaying either one individual item from the database or multiple.
